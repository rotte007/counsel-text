What Is "Counsel"?

Counsel is a game where:
• You are a ruler faced with recurring national crises.
• You have three Al advisors. Each one:
• Has a pubily persona (eg. Treasurer, General, Diplomat)
• Has a secret goal (eg. weaken ruler, Decrease stability, increase army statistic for coup)
• Your advisors can choose when to speak, stay silent, or respond to your comments
• After hearing them, you choose a policy
• Advisors gain influence when your choice aligns with their hidden goal


Your job: make good decisions while figuring out who's trying to manipulate you.

Advisor 1: "Borders must close immediately to contain this threat."
Advisor 2: *.. (silent)
Advisor 3: "The people need hope. Let them pray."

The player can speak:

*"All: what are your concerns?"
5. Advisors can respond - and may adapt their tactics.
